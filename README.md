## Overview
This is just an archive of any data analysis/visualization projects I help out with on the side. Primarily (and preferentially) done in R, occassionally done in Python. 

I don't do this for payment and rarely do it for credit, I just like getting the experience!

You can contact me at anthony.grigsby@colostate.edu if you want to discuss having your data wrangled/manipulated/cleaned/visualized/criticized.
